This project was a further exploration of my CAD abilities and an interest in the Saturn V Apollo rocket. Not only did this project end up improving my CAD skills, but also taught me about the makeup of the Saturn V rocket and the different components that made up the F-1 Rocketdyne engine. Over 6 months of my time went into making a very detailed Saturn V model. In the future, I hope to 3D print this model to add to my collection of other rockets I have made. I also put the STEP files on Onshape to make it easier to view. [Link to Onshape CAD Model](.
